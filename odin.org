To thoroughly test graph algorithms (in lieu of or in preparation for
proof), it is very useful to have a means to create randomized graphs
with certain characteristics.  NetworkX has a few generators at its
disposal for creating graphs with deeper properties than I have
knowledge of, but the following function is able to create a random
graph with nodes having randomized properties.

  If `degree` is a tuple, it is assumed to be a (min, max) tuple
  defining an inclusive range of possible degrees.
    
  Each `properties` value can be a function of a random number
  generator.  If the value does not have `__call__` defined, it will be
  assumed a string unless, as a string, it is one of the following:
    
  - 'int(n,m)' :: a random integer in [n, m]
  - 'float()'  :: a random floating point number in [0, 1)
  - 'bool(n)'  :: a random boolean with a probability of truth between 0
                  and 1 inclusive (where 1 is True).
    
  If the property value is neither callable nor a string of this form,
  then the value is simply set raw.

  Pass in a single argument, the degree of the graph, to get the
  bare-minimum graph (with a certain edge probability):
    
      >>> G = random_graph(50)
      >>> len(G.nodes())
      50
  
  Pass in a tuple to get a range of values:
    
      >>> G = random_graph((40, 60))
      >>> len(G.nodes()) in range(40, 60 + 1)
      True
    
  You can also use a few intelligent arguments, such as bool(n):
  
      >>> G = random_graph(10, marked='bool(1)')
      >>> all(map(lambda n: G.node[n]['marked'], G.node))
      True
      >>> G = random_graph(10, marked='bool(0)')
      >>> any(map(lambda n: G.node[n]['marked'], G.node))
      False
    
  float():
  
      >>> G = random_graph(1000, weight='float()')
      >>> .45 < sum(map(lambda n: G.node[n]['weight'], G.node)) / 1000 < .55
      True
    
  and int(min, max):
    
      >>> G = random_graph(10, age='int(40, 50)')
      >>> all(map(lambda n: G.node[n]['age'] in range(40, 50 + 1), G.node))
      True
  
  For any attribute, you can specify a function or a generator.  You can
  even supply a function that *returns* a generator.  All functions must
  take exactly one required argument, a random number generator, as its
  first parameter.
  
  (ref:smp - optionify random thingy)
  
  Consider the following:
  
      >>> graph = random_graph(5, weight=(i for i in range(5)))
      >>> sorted([graph.node[n]['weight'] for n in graph.nodes()])
      [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

In playing with the tool for a while, I've come to see a few use cases
for the ability to create 'on the fly' generators with lambda
expressions.  The code currently checks for functions by checking if
they define =__call__=, and this is good behavior.  However, it is
possible that such a function could return a generator object, so we
need to run through each property /first/ to check if calling any
existing functions yields a generator (no pun intended).

For any graphical interface that aspires to be what SSA Tool is, a
means to actually view a more-or-less interactive graph on-screen is
invaluable.  In this document, we explore the creation of such a tool.

Manifested as a subclass of the =Canvas= widget in Tkinter, =Grapher=
will paint any NetworkX-style graph according to a given layout
algorithm and customizable node/edge-painting functions.  Usage is
pretty simple:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import networkx as nx
  import tkinter as tk
  from ssa import Grapher

  simple = tk.Tk()

  grapher = Grapher(simple)

  graph = nx.hypercube_graph(4)

  grapher.set_layout_algorithm(nx.random_layout)
  grapher.set_graph(graph)

  grapher.pack()
  grapher.paint()
#+END_SRC
****** Dependencies
The only hard-and-fast dependency of this component is,
unsurprisingly, Tkinter.  Given that this project as a whole can't
hope to implement all of even the most common layout algorithms,
NetworkX layout algorithms are used throughout this documentation in
the examples, but /they are not required to use the widget/.  Each and
every one of these layout algorithms require the =numpy= module, so it
is recommended that this is installed if you plan to use the
=networkx= module.  =Grapher= is designed to work with the format it
uses.  (See the section on [[id:7DC6B787-4AE5-45FF-9D78-8ABE8FD3E38F][layout algorithms]] for more information.)

This example shows a window with a =Grapher= and a button which, when
pressed, will create a new sparse graph of increasing size.
#+BEGIN_SRC python

  def on_reconfigure(event):

  def new_graph():
      global n
      n += 1
      grapher.set_graph(Generators.sparse_graph(n, marked='bool(.25)'))
      grapher.paint()

  n = 5

  root = tk.Tk()
  grapher = Grapher(root,
                    layout_algorithm=nx.circular_layout,
                    node_painter=Grapher.circle_node_painter,
                    background='#dddddd')
  tk.Button(root, text='New Graph', command=new_graph).pack()

***** Overview
****** Initialization

:END:
As you'll recall from the overview above, the constructor takes four
arguments aside from those related directly to Tkinter:
- =graph= :: a NetworkX-style graph.
- =layout_algorithm= :: a function from NetworkX-style graphs to
     layout dictionaries.  (This format is discussed in [[id:7DC6B787-4AE5-45FF-9D78-8ABE8FD3E38F][Layout
     Algorithms]].)
- =node_painter= :: a function to paint a node onto the canvas.  See
                    [[id:839E1EA2-74A4-4EB1-A79A-54FA6E7A1A51][Node Painters]].
- =edge_painter= :: a function to paint an edge onto the canvas.  See
                    [[id:25FE8932-BFB7-4F36-AEF3-DA58C6634FBE][Edge Painters]].

Since Python evaluates the default arguments at interpretation time
rather than use-time, we cannot give appropriate default values.  To
compensate, we set their default values to =None= and then check to
see if they need to be given the appropriate defaults.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  if layout_algorithm is None:
      layout_algorithm = lambda G: \
                         {n: (0, 0) for n in G.nodes()}
  if node_painter is None:
      node_painter = Grapher.plain_node_painter
  if edge_painter is None:
      edge_painter = Grapher.plain_edge_painter
#+END_SRC
You'll notice that =graph= is not handled so; this case is handled
specially by =paint=.  This decision was made to make this file as
lean as possible---setting a reasonable default for this value would
necessitate importing the NetworkX graph manipulation library.

Using the setter functions defined in [[id:E4FB92BE-FD81-4716-8B23-EA63352114F3][Customization]], we use these
constructor arguments to set the appropriate settings.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  self.set_graph(graph)
  self.set_layout_algorithm(layout_algorithm)
  self.set_node_painter(node_painter)
  self.set_edge_painter(edge_painter)
#+END_SRC

Along with the painters, layout algorithms are at the core of this
widget.  Without them, the widget has no hope of success.  Due to
their varying complexity and ready availability, this widget doesn't
attempt to provide such algorithms as part of the structure.  Thus,
there is no useful default.  (There is a default to ensure
non-crashing behavior with a minimalistic use, but it simply maps all
nodes to =(0, 0)=.)

So how does this tool expect these layout algorithms to act?  NetworkX
provides [[http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/drawing.html#module-networkx.drawing.layout][several layout algorithms]] already (which unfortunately
require =numpy= as a dependency), so this widget is designed to use
the output of these algorithms.  These layout algorithms return a very
simple and sensible structure.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  {
    node: (x, y),
    ...
  }
#+END_SRC
As a dictionary of x--y coordinates indexed by node, you can actually
use any Python structure that mimics such access.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  coordinates = layout[node]
  x = coordinates[0]
  y = coordinates[1]
#+END_SRC

Actually providing these layout algorithms is left up to the user of
this widget.  Since it has nothing directly to do with really
/painting/ the graph, it has no particular business in this class.

****** Node and Edge Painters

One of the great strengths of this widget is its ability to be
customized.  Graphs are capable of holding a lot of data---anything
can have properties associated with it that this widget has little
hope of anticipating.  This was recognized from the start---the
customization of these painters is fully supported.

However, there are a couple things that are worth noting about these
painters---not the least of which is the signature each painter should
have:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def my_node_painter(canvas, layout, graph, node):
      # paint the node onto the canvas
  def my_edge_painter(canvas, layout, graph, source, sink):
      # paint the edge onto the canvas
#+END_SRC
A lot of responsibility is given to these functions, and perhaps this
responsibility should be mitigated.  (See the [[id:DED5600A-3B04-4C03-BA79-76ECBB3001BB]['todo' item]] below.)

See the [[id:8F3C5154-5DD4-495C-BA63-475CF2047455][basic painters]] below to see full, minimal examples of this.  If
you're unfamiliar with NetworkX's ability to store node data, you
should check out [[id:59724273-7AA1-42B6-9880-B0DEB3261C07][the example of that below]] as well.

******* TODO Simplify Painting
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       DED5600A-3B04-4C03-BA79-76ECBB3001BB
:END:
Right now, customized painting leaves a lot of responsibility to the
widget user.  It could potentially be simplified by returning a
dictionary of attributes to use instead and then using this to
interface directly with the canvas.

In any case, a separate function should provide this interface in
order to preserve the raw power of the existing behavior.

***** Painting the Graph
:PROPERTIES:

****** Preliminary Checks
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0E9E8D58-0736-403D-A22D-58C5FA0BE1F1
:END:
Before we proceed, we need to see if we have everything we need to
paint the graph.  There are two basic components that we need to
actually paint the graph.  If we have no =graph= to paint, well,
hopefully the problem here is obvious.  If we must lay out the graph
and have no =layout_algorithm=, then we have no way of determining the
positions of a given node within a graph.  The same applies if we must
/not/ lay out the graph and have no existing positions to use.  We do
some very simple (and incomprehensive) preliminary checks to avoid
running into problems down the line.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  if self.graph is None:
      raise Exception('No graph specified.')
  if do_layout and self.layout_algorithm is None:
      raise Exception('No layout algorithm specified.')
  if not do_layout and self.layout is None:
      raise Exception('Re-layout prohibited and no existing layout in place.')
#+END_SRC

Additionally, =layout_algorithm= must be a function (or at least,
Pythonically speaking, /act/ like one).  We further check to see if
the member is callable as a function.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  if not callable(self.layout_algorithm):
      raise Exception('Layout algorithm must be callable.')
#+END_SRC

****** Preparing to Paint
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       DFADA623-F79E-40F5-9A2D-C8953019D8DB
:END:
To paint a clear picture, we first must remove all of the objects that
we've (potentially) already painted.  We can delete all of these like
as below.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  self.delete(tk.ALL)
#+END_SRC

To get the node layout, there are actually a few steps we have to
take.  Before we do anything, we need to determine the current
dimensions of the widget.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  wd = self.winfo_width()
  dp = self.winfo_height()
#+END_SRC
(Note that =wd= and =dp= are abbreviation for width and depth.)

If we were asked to recalculate the layout (the default), then we
reset =layout= to the results of a fresh run of the
=layout_algorithm= on =graph=.  Using =wd= and =dp= calculated above,
we then normalize =layout= to account for the current dimensions of
the width, using =padx= and =pady= appropriately.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  if do_layout:
      self.layout = self.layout_algorithm(self.graph)

  normalized_layout = {node: (self.layout[node][0] * (wd - 2*padx) + padx,
                              self.layout[node][1] * (dp - 2*pady) + pady)
                       for node in self.layout}
#+END_SRC
Do recall that =layout= is kept as a dictionary from nodes to
coordinate pairs =(x, y)= where both /x/ and /y/ are kept in the range
[0, 1].  These values indicate their relative positions on the canvas;
=0= indicates the far left (or top) where =1= indicates the far right
(or bottom).  These values are scaled to the current width and depth
of the widget while with the padding specified by =padx= and =pady=.

When creating functions that are generally useful (say, [[id:0B00DABF-26A1-49CC-A37C-5E011BAE4BB4][a circle with
variable radius]]), you have to create them as functions that take these
variable values (e.g. =radius=) and returns a function that uses these
values.

***** TODO Draggable nodes
Since the canvas is just a collection of items, we can add event
handlers for all nodes via the use of tags.  As good as layout
algorithms are, everybody likes their own setup.

In order to keep class as simple as possible, perhaps this should be
implemented in a separate subclass.  Given that Python supports
multiple inheritance (to a point; there are of course
obvious language-agnostic concerns), we could then just combine this
with the animated subclass.
***** TODO Postscript Export
We can leverage =tk.Canvas.postscript= to support Postscript export.
This would perhaps be very valuable to TeX export.
**** Draggable Grapher
**** Animated Grapher
We now have a means of drawing a graph on-screen in an easy-to-use
Tkinter widget.  We can paint the graph, change the graph, and repaint
it effortlessly.  While it is straightforward to do this, it can get
repetitive.  In their essence, self-stabilizing algorithms operate on
graphs and change them /continuously/; to see this change, this
paint--repaint sequence must be executed over and over again while
going at a slow enough pace to actually /see/ the change.  Clearly,
there is enough functionality here to encapsulate it in a separate
=GraphAnimator= class as a subclass of =Grapher=.

The primary thought behind this implementation stems from the natural
sequence of steps that a self-stabilizing algorithm---or, in fairness,
/any/ animation---produces.  =GraphAnimator= uses the paradigm of
stop-motion animation by storing a queue of graphs (or as we shall
see, a much more compact queue of changes deltas) and painting them
one after another at specified intervals.

We subclass =Grapher= and a single instance variable:
- =interval= :: the time, in seconds, between steps of the animation
To separate the functionality into the logical concept of an 'animated
graph' and a 'graph animator', we will be creating two classes
- =AnimatedGraph= :: a new class that operates on a NetworkX graph and
     provides logic to generate successive graphs through a series of
     deltas.
- =GraphAnimator= :: a subclass of =Grapher= to display objects of
     type =AnimatedGraph=
We then define logic for queueing these steps and then finally logic
for performing the actual animation.

Just as you test the quality of the brakes before the power of an
engine, we define a flag and setter for stopping the animation.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def stop(self):
      self.should_stop = True
#+END_SRC
  
By using the =Timer= class from the =threading= module, we daisy-chain
the painting of next graphs.  Since =_queue_next_graph= is a
relatively expensive step, we queue the next step to start before we
calculate the next graph.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def start(self):
      if not self.should_stop:
          self.paint(self.next_graph, do_layout=False)
          threading.Timer(self.interval, self.start, [self]).start()
          self._queue_next_graph()
#+END_SRC
Queueing the next frame before calculating it /does/ introduce a race
condition!  It is possible that the animator could skip a frame---or
worse, show a partially updated graph---if
- the interpreter is extraordinarily slow,
- there are many properties to each node in the graph, or
- the update interval is extremely short.
This arises because =next_graph= is altered in-place in
=_queue_next_graph= /during/ the countdown for the next frame.  If
this countdown finishes before =next_graph= is ready it will /still be
painted/, it just may be incorrect.

It would seem that this risk is inherent in multi-threading this
solution and the risk could be avoided by single-threading.  However,
this has other consequences that are unacceptable.  The naïve
single-threaded approach would look similar to the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle nil :noweb-ref nil
  while not self.should_stop:
      self.paint(do_layout=False)
      self._queue_next_graph()
#+END_SRC
In this approach, there is no chance for =should_stop= to change and
the animation would continue /ad infinitum/ with no hope of a graceful
exit.
